# Citi Bike Data and Potential Bikesharing in Iowa. 
Module 14 Work

## Project Overvew



## Resources
- Data Source: Citi Bike Dataset from 2019
- Software: Tableau, Python (Jupyter Notebook)

## Results
In this section, I record an observation or result related to each of seven graphics based on the bike ride data. The graphics in this section are screenshots of my Tableau Story around the NYC Citi Bike ride data. The entire story can be found as part of my Tableau notebook here: 
[Tozer's Tableau Link for Bike Ride Data](https://public.tableau.com/views/BikeshareData_16439399574750/NYCABikeStory?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

1) Checkout Time by Gender:

![CheckoutTimeByGender](https://github.com/Tozerh/bikesharing/blob/main/Checkout%20Time%20by%20Genders.PNG)

The graph above indicates that males are two and a half times more likely to checkout a bike than the other genders combined, and check the bikes out for slightly longer amounts of time. 

2) Checkout Time for Users: 

![CheckoutTimeforUsers](https://github.com/Tozerh/bikesharing/blob/main/Checkout%20Time%20for%20Users.PNG)

The above visualation shows us that trips above one hour are exceedingly rare, and that most utilization of Citi bike share rides happens with trips under twenty minutes. 

3) Trips by Weekday 

![TripsByWeekday](https://github.com/Tozerh/bikesharing/blob/main/Trips%20by%20Weekday.PNG)

This visualization demonstrates a couple of interesting facts about bike share usage: 
  - Utilization during the weekend is much higher during the day. 
  - Utilization during the week corresponds closely to before and after traditional work hours in New York City (9AM to 5PM)
  
4) Trips by Gender by Weekday per Hour

![TripsByGenderWeekdayPerHour](https://github.com/Tozerh/bikesharing/blob/main/Trips%20by%20Gender%20(Weekday%20per%20Hour)%20.PNG)

Here we see that, as in our first graph, males are much more likely to utilize a Citi bike for a ride. While the raw number of rides is much higher for males, we see the same distribution of rides for the male, female, and unknown genders. 

5) User Trips by Gender by Weekday

## Summary

Other viz: 
Examine the relationship between speed and trip duration (do more people like going farther more slowly (poss. tourists/people out for a leisurely ride) or shortly more quickly (errands, primary or secondary transportation mode to/from work).
